  - Full recipe instructions.
  - Ingredients and their measurements in a table.
  - Tags associated with the recipe.
  - A link to a YouTube video demonstrating the recipe (if available).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
